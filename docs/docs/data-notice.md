This page describes some functionalities of DataPM.

## Where is the data stored?

The data that is referenced by a Package isn't hosted in DataPM, instead it lies somewhere else, and the package files describe every aspect necessary to discovering, evaluating, obtaining, parsing, and deploying data - such that a computer instead of a human can perform those tasks.

Package Files must reference data in the way that the target audience and the target DataPM registry can access the data. In the future DataPM registries will support deploying the data and schema, but for now the registry only supports deploying the schema. Therefore you must host the data on another solution.

The unclaimed data has not been rehosted or republished, instead it was collected by our system in order to catalog them and make them available to more users publicly.

## The advantages of publishing with DataPM

Publishing your data in DataPM gives you multiple advantages.

1. Your data will be cataloged under your name.
2. Your data will be protected by DataPM's advanced security and permission systems.
3. Your data will be available to a big number of users and it'll be very easy to consume from our provided connectors.

## Private vs public DataPM repositories

The primary global public registry is [datapm.io](https://datapm.io), it's free and offers tons of great data packages, catalogs and collections.
It has a lot of data and is very useful for finding data from various categories.

Private registries require providing your own cloud or on-premises hosting using a Kubernetes, Docker, VMware, or some other similar container service.

Hosting your own DataPM registry allows your team to combine highly sensitive private data and 3rd party data to create rich insights and competitive advantages.

Also, a private DataPM registry is a great way to create catalogs of your organization's data, while maintaining absolute control over every aspect of the data's presence. Imagine having a complete index of all of the data in your organization - without copying data or changing your existing architecture.
