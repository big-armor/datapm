DataPM's mission is to make the world's data more accessible. This command line client helps you...

* Search for and discover new data
* Aquire new data easily

The DataPM client is easily installed, and almost every task is a self explanatory single command execution. The DataPM client features an easy to use prompts system, and always gives you easy to copy next steps after each command. 


## Install the DataPM Command Line Client

If you do not already have NodeJS and NPM, install them using the following link

https://nodejs.org/en/

Verify that you have installed Node 12 or greater, and the latest npm client. 

```text
node -v

npm -v
```

Install the datapm-client package globally. This allows you to run the datapm command from any working directory.

```text
npm install -g datapm-client
```

Verify that the datapm-client package is installed

```text
datapm --version
```

## View Help Options

The command line client has a standard "--help" option that shows the available commands, and outputs help when you enter an unrecognized command option. Just append "--help" to any command to view more information.

```text
datapm --help

datapm publish --help
```

## Generate An API Key

To publish packages or perform any authenticated tasks, you'll need to add an API key to your command line client. Here are the instructions to generate an API Key.

1. Using a web browser, [visit the registry] (/)
1. Log in or sign up as a new user
1. Click your profile icon in the upper right
1. Click "API Keys"
1. Click "Create New API Key"
1. Copy the command provided
1. Paste the command into your terminal

You will now have an API Key associated with the registry. Your command line client will authenticate as your user, and perform actions on your behalf. If the registry is private, it will also have been added to the DataPM command line client configuration - so it will be used for searches, etc. 

## Search Registries

You can [search the registry](/) registry using a modern web browser. Or use the following command to search via the command line client. 

```text
datapm search "example search terms"
```

Your search result will include packages with titles, descriptions, or keywords that match your search terms. 

## Consume Data

Use the following command to retrieve a batch data package from the datapm.io public registry. 

```text
datapm fetch datapm/example
```

You can also fetch packages from other registries by specifying the package URL. 

```text
datapm fetch https://datapm-example.company.com/catalog/package
```

## Publish Data

*Important Note:* Right now, DataPM only supports publishing data schemas. So you must host the actual data in another location - such as GitHub or a public web server. And that hosting must be publicly available. In the future, DataPM will also support hosting the data itself for public and private data hosting.

Use the command line client to create a data package file based on any publicly available data set. 

```text
datapm generate-package https://some-web-server.com/path/to/data.csv
```

Follow the prompts to complete the package file. Then use the following command to publish the package. 

```text
datapm publish my-package-file.datapm.json
```

You can update the schema and statistics in the package file using the following command. 

```text
datapm update my-package-file.datapm.json
```

And then you can re-publish the updates using the same publish command above. 


### Add Registries

By default the command line client only interacts with the the [datapm.io](https://datapm.io) registry. You can host your own private or public registries, and you will want to add those registries to your command line client. 

```
datapm registry add datapm.my-domain.com 443
```

Use the [Generate An API Key](#generate-an-api-key) section above to add a specific API for that registry.

You can also remove a registry with the following command

```
datapm registry remove datapm.my-domain.com 443
```

### Manage Configuration

You can view and remove the local configuration using the following commands. 

```
datapm configuration show

datapm configuration reset
```
